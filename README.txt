this program uses the golden ratio to create a golden rectangle. 
the rectangle is split into squares containing the three control
points needed for a quadratic bezier curve. The curve continues 
from square to square creating a spiral pattern. This pattern
is reused a different angles creating the combined pattern
representing the inner sunflower pattern.
